        <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
        <p>"Moneyball" tells the story of Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, who defies conventional wisdom and challenges the system by using computer-generated analysis to draft his players. With the help of statistician Peter Brand, Beane selects undervalued players based on their on-base percentage rather than traditional scouting methods. As the A's embark on an unprecedented winning streak, they defy all odds and capture the attention of the baseball world.</p>
