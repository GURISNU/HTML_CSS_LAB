            <p>League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Riot Games.</p>
            <img src="league_of_legends_gameplay.png" alt="League of Legends Gameplay">
            <p>LoL matches are played on a map called Summoner's Rift, where two teams of five players each compete to destroy the opposing team's Nexus.</p>
            <p>Players choose from a roster of over 150 champions, each with unique abilities and roles such as tanks, mages, marksmen, assassins, and supports.</p>
            <p>Matches in LoL are divided into different game modes including Summoner's Rift, ARAM (All Random All Mid), and various rotating game modes.</p>
            <p>League of Legends hosts an annual World Championship, where the best teams from around the world compete for the Summoner's Cup. For more information, visit the <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/esports/">official League of Legends esports website</a>.</p>
            <p>Aside from the competitive scene, League of Legends also has a vibrant community of content creators, streamers, and fan events. Players can engage with the game through regular updates, patches, and events that introduce new champions, skins, and game modes.</p>

            <p>Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is an auto-battler game mode within League of Legends, developed and published by Riot Games.</p>
            <p>In TFT, players strategically draft and position champions onto a chess-like board, then watch as their team automatically battles against other players' teams.</p>
            <p>Champions in TFT belong to different classes (e.g., Brawler, Sorcerer) and origins (e.g., Void, Star Guardian), and they synergize with each other to gain powerful bonuses.</p>
            <p>TFT matches consist of multiple rounds where players earn gold, buy champions and items, and optimize their team composition to defeat opponents and survive until the end.</p>
            <p>Teamfight Tactics has its own competitive scene, with events such as the TFT World Championship. For more information, visit the <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/tag/teamfight-tactics">official Teamfight Tactics website</a>.</p>
            <p>Similar to League of Legends, TFT receives regular updates and balance changes to keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. Players can also participate in seasonal ranked play, climb the ranks, and earn rewards based on their performance.</p>

            <h2>Publisher & Designers</h2>
            <h3>League of Legends</h3>
            <p>League of Legends was developed and published by <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/">Riot Games</a>, an American video game developer founded in 2006 by Brandon "Ryze" Beck and Marc "Tryndamere" Merrill. Riot Games is headquartered in Los Angeles, California.</p>
            <p>The game was designed by a team of developers led by Tom "Zileas" Cadwell and Steve "Guinsoo" Feak, who drew inspiration from the Warcraft III custom map, Defense of the Ancients (DotA).</p>
            <h3>Teamfight Tactics</h3>
            <p>Teamfight Tactics is also developed and published by Riot Games as a game mode within League of Legends. The TFT team at Riot Games is led by Stephen "Mortdog" Mortimer, who serves as the lead designer of the game mode.</p>
            <p>Teamfight Tactics was released in June 2019 as a response to the growing popularity of auto-battler games. It quickly gained a dedicated player base within the League of Legends community and continues to receive updates and new content regularly.</p>
